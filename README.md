***Archived:***
This repository is kept here just to: show off some random stuff we've being doing in my uni. Like, hey, I did some MATLAB, so that should be a nice memory, right?

# lab-tac-t3-4
The repository contains two scripts (.m and .mlx). The prior is an ordinary MATLAB script, the former - a live version of the code.
Download the live version (.mlx), change the values of T, k according to your task and you're good to go.

The saved plots are located in the created /plots folder.
(Note that step and impulse response for the simple differentiating function are not plotted due to the function specific)

Plots look like this:
